# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

This project focuses on the implementation of stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO) in the C programming language. It provides an understanding of these data structures and their applications.

## Description

The repository contains the following files:

- **main.c:** This is the main C file that includes the entry point of the program. It demonstrates the usage of stacks and queues by performing various operations.
- **stack.c:** This file implements the stack data structure using an array or a linked list, providing functions for push, pop, peek, and other stack-related operations.
- **queue.c:** This file implements the queue data structure using an array or a linked list, providing functions for enqueue, dequeue, peek, and other queue-related operations.
- **stack.h:** This header file declares the functions and structures used in the stack implementation.
- **queue.h:** This header file declares the functions and structures used in the queue implementation.
- **README.md:** This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

## Requirements

To compile and run the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C library (stdlib.h, stdio.h)
- (If applicable) Any additional libraries or dependencies required by the project
